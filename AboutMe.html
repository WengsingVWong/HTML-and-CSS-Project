                Hi! My name is Wengsing Wong, and I am the creator of this project. I am currently a rising 
                junior at Baruch College studying Computer Information Systems (CIS) and minoring in Mathematics. 
                This is the first HTML project I have attempted.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, writing stories, drawing comics, and reading 
                fantasy novels. I also enjoy crosswords, sudoku, and nonograms.
            </p>
