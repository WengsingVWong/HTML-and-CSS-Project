# HTML-and-CSS-Project
A project I am undertaking to practice my HTML and CSS skills

On June 30, 2019, I uploaded what I've completed so far to my GitHub profile:
  - The **index** html file is the homepage. Currently, there is no content on the page except for a message from the creator (me!).
  - The **AboutMe** html file is the "About Me" section of my project. It contains some information about me as well as links to 
  my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub profile.
  - The **ComicsArchives** html file is the main section of my project. It will contain the comics that I have previously uploaded 
  to my project, placed in chronological order. Currently, there is no content on the page except for a message from the creator (me!).
