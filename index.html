                    "Home" represents the homepage. It will display the latest comics I have uploaded to the site.
                    "About Me" links to a page listing some information about me, as well as my contact information
                    (professional email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
                    "Comics Archives" links to the older comics that were moved from the homepage. As I add more
                    content, it might be necessary to add a submenu for months or years.

                Hi! Wengsing here. Welcome to my webpage! As you can see, the site is still under construction and 
                will probably stay that way for awhile. Don't worry though; I'm working hard behind the scenes to
                get the site up and running. Thanks for your patience!
